## Adding extra functionality

SpriteKit is missing some useful functionality, thankfully we have bundled some together for you.

# Summary

Great, you now have everything in place to get started building your game. Before we move on though, lets build our project to make sure that everything is working okay. The quickest way to do this is to use the shortcut `CMD+B` to build our project. We don't want to run our project yet because we would just have a blank screen. We do want to build the project though so that the compiler can help tell us if anything is broken. If you have a clean build with no errors you should be all set!
