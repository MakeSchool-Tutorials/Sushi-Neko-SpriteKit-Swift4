Welcome to bonus stage! Your task, should you accept, is to work through the list of challenges and take your game to the next level.

There are no solutions provided and I would encourage you to discuss potential solutions with your fellow students, it's good to collaborate and often results in new exciting directions.

It would be a good idea to create a **new branch** in your repo for these challenges.

# Improve the main menu

The main menu is a little boring, just a play button.  Although this is certainly functional it would be nice to dress this up and at the very least display the game title.

> [challenge]
> Improve the main menu intro, one idea might be the mat could roll down the screen and display a **Sushi Neko** title using an *SKLabel*.
> **Hint**: Take a look at *mat.png*

#Game over

When the game ends there is no real fan fare, why not use some of the skills employed in the last chapter?

> [challenge]
> Improve the game over stage.

#Sushi variety

How about adding a little variety to the sushi?

> [challenge]
> Can you create different types of sushi, perhaps some of these have different point values or even change the game in some way.

#Game Center

This challenge is a bit more advanced.  However, as a developer you need to challenge yourself to progress.  You should be familiar with using Google to help solve problems, it will come in handy I'm sure :]

Here is a good starting place.  [Game Center](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/)

> [challenge]
> Implement a Game Center high score mechanic and for a further challenge add achievements.

#Summary

Congratulations on completing the bonus stage!
